        Version control software is used to track and manage changes to files. They keep track of previous versions of files
        which is handy if you need to go back and compare changes between different versions of a file or undo changes made.
        VCS allows you to see what was changed, when it was changed, and if working in a group, who made the change.

        'Add' is a command that adds a change in a file to a new file, to the working directory to the staging area.
        Add draws attention to it without making any permanent changes.

        'Commit' is a command that takes the files from the staging area and makes the changes permanent. Commit is recording
        the changes.

        'Push' is a command used to transfer the commits, or changed files, to the remote repository. This lets everyone
        that has access to the remote repository view it.

        'Pull' is the command used to download the files from the remote repository to the local repository. It is actually
        first doing the git fetch command (downloading the content from the remote repository) followed by the git merge
        command combines the current branch with a specified branch) you can check that the changes are what you expect.

        'Clone' is the command used to copy an exisiting repo into a new directory at a different location.
